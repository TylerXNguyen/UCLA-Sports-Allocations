# UCLA-Sports-Allocations
From Course UCLA Digital Humanities 140, topic in researching UCLA sports and the true costs

The way money is spent in colleges becomes highly critiqued by many over the years. Some may point out how high of a salary some college coaches can earn while students struggle to pay for tuition. In the following research, I intend to find how money is generated and allocated in college sports. 

This research may be important to others and especially me since it affects how money can be more efficiently used in higher education or it can clarify why sports is so useful to schools. Currently, I am a fourth-year student at UCLA, one of the largest public institutions in North America, and being involved in the school's finances can be insightful to not only me but other students who use these services. It may explain a lot about the process of college sports and how transparent schools are with their sports funds.

The data used is from the College Athletics Financial Information (CAFI) Database which posts all the money used in college sports from different leagues and divisions in a transparent manner. It includes different NCAA subdivisions, conferences, and the years of median earnings/spendings.

Since the data used has many years and easy aggregates to sort by, it may be useful to create graphs that illustrate change over time. Simple bar graphs and histograms can work, but it will be sure to include key details and listings of other schools or divisions. The values are large so they can also be condensed in the graphs with comparisons between other schools' expenses or earnings.

This research project is intended to either illustrate transparency and effectiveness in a school's allocation of funds for their sports programs or it will reveal and justify why many schools are under high criticism for their funds in sports. While comparing the data for UCLA, it will help generalize the picture to most schools and help generalize these details without making any assumptions. UCLA, currently ranked the number 1 public school (USNews, 2022), will be a great choice to research school spending because of its large student population and highly competitive sports programs. Hopefully, we can find data and perform analysis that reveals how well UCLA allocates its sports funds and compare it to the entire of sports programs across the US over time.
